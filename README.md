For this version, I'm planing to build a simplest site just for show my blog posts.

It was painful to build and then release a full features blog site that with a beautiful front-end UI and a powerful back-end server.

I was planing for my new blog site from Jan of this year, but as you can see, almost 10 months past, the new blog was still working in progress.

I have too much things plan to do after I have built this blog, but it just like the bottleneck, it's blocking me on the way!

After spent a lot of time for consider how can I broke the bottleneck, now I have the answer.

I have created this new repository to instead of the old one, and start by build a simplest site which don't even have a back-end server.

The new simplest one is going to be hosted by GitHub pages service in my plan, and it only need to show posts list and show the content of each post.

Don't even need features like comment or searching, these features will be joined step by step, and the first step is build the simplest one.
